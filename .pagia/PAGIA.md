## Code Conventions

### Coding Standards

1. **General**:
   - Use ES modules with proper import sorting and extensions.
   - Prefer `function` keyword over arrow functions for top-level definitions.
   - Use explicit return type annotations for top-level functions.
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for files/classes, camelCase for vars/funcs).

2. **React**:
   - Follow proper React component patterns with explicit Props types.
   - Use proper error handling patterns (avoid try/catch when possible).

3. **Clarity**:
   - Avoid nested ternary operators - prefer switch statements or if/else chains.
   - Choose clarity over brevity - explicit code is often better.
